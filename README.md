# Brillouin-Optomechanics-Tutorial
This repository was created to share the slides I presented at the tutorial talk at the [https://indico.mpl.mpg.de/event/13/page/20-4th-workshop-on-optomechanics-and-brillouin-scattering]( 4th WOMBAT (Workshop on Brillouin and Optomechanics)), held at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Ligh in Erlangen, Germany.
